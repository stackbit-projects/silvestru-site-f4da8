          Get your foot in the door... wearing fuzzy pink slippers with
          steel-reinforced soles
        content: >
          Do you know how many pitch emails the average CxO gets? Do you know
          what happens to 99% of those emails?


          Spam. Trash. "Please stop emailing me I will call the cops". Or the
          most painful one - ignored.


          The way to get a decision-maker's attention and their reply is not by
          doing what everyone else is doing. There is a better way to get your
          foot in the door (ask me).

        content: >
          Do you have an email list with subscribers? Do you know what to send
          them? Do you have a proven structure for email campaigns? Are your
          emails getting opened and acted upon? Or are they ignored, or worse
          even - unsubscribed?


          Having the right strategy coupled with strong copy is a sure way to
          milk the very profitable udder of email marketing.

          I tried the Don Draper thing for a while. It was fun until it wasn't.
          Now I do all my work sober. If I hate the project (or you) so much
          that I have to imbibe substances to "get in the flow" we probably
          won't work together. Not being elitist, just putting it out there.
          Note to self: this might be an admission that I do have *some* values.

        subtitle: Pages that have sales on them
        content: >
          Technically, "everything" is a sales page. In practice however, these
          tend to be the type of pages that are seen by people already somewhat
          familiar with your company or at least they have clicked on a very
          enticing banner expecting more carrot. Clever!


          But now the real heavy duty begins: presenting your story, your
          product, its benefits, answering objections -- all structured in a way
          that keeps them hooked and engaged so that when they check Facebook or
          what their dog is doing on their home webcam, they come back to resume
          reading all about your enticing offer. And of course, eventually they
          will click the CTA.
