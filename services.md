          Get your foot in the door... wearing fuzzy pink slippers with
          steel-reinforced soles
        content: >
          Do you know how many pitch emails the average CxO gets? Do you know
          what happens to 99% of those emails?


          Spam. Trash. "Please stop emailing me I will call the cops".


          Or just simply (and the most painful one) - ignored.


          Want to reverse that trend and start getting calls and meetings? I can
          help.

          Do you have an email list with subscribers? Do you know what to send
          them on a daily and weekly basis? Do you have a proven structure for
          email campaigns? Are your emails getting opened and acted upon? Or are
          they ignored, or worse even - unsubscribed?


          Having the right strategy coupled with strong copy is a sure way to
          milk the very profitable udder of email marketing.

          Technically, "everything" is a sales page. In practice however, these
          tend to be the type of pages that are seen by people already somewhat
          familiar with your company or at least they have clicked on a very
          enticing banner promising a carrot. Clever!


          But now the real heavy duty begins: presenting your story, your
          product, its benefits, answering objections -- all of this structured
          in a way that keeps them hooked and engaged all the way down to your
          offer and the call to action.

        subtitle: How many leads (and money) are you leaving on the table?
        content: >
          It takes less than 2 seconds for a prospect to form an opinion on
          whether you are someone they want to do business with... or not. All
          of this thanks to your website.


          Moreover, your site is not only an opportunity to build good will and
          trust but also a way to capture leads, emails and other data for
          further marketing purposes.


          Is your website fully optimized according to CRO principles? Or do
          users have to whip out a magnifying glass to find what they need?

        title_align: left
        content: >
          An arm and a leg! Add-on saw for just $997.


          But seriously, how long is a piece of string? Each project is
          different - has different challenges and outcomes and thus has a
          different value. Not only could I lose but also it wouldn't be fair to
          you as to **what the solution is worth to you**. So it varies.


          That said, if you're a bargain hunter, I'm not your guy.

          1.  You get in touch


          2.  We talk (Skype, Zoom, phone)


          3.  If we're a good fit, I send you a proposal


          4.  If you agree on that and pay, I send you a brief to complete


          5.  I wait on you to complete the brief and send it back to me


          6.  I write the copy


          7.  I send you the copy


          8.  You put the copy where it's supposed to be and launch it


          9.  Victory dance in our rooms/office/stables


          2 copy revisions are included free of charge in the initial proposal.
          My only condition is that we both agree on the final version. If you
          tweak the copy without discussing, I can't be held accountable for the
          lack of results.
