          "I'm not going to weigh in on the controversy here, but I would like
          to put in a good word for Silvestru. I hired him last month for a VSL
          project and I'm very pleased with the results. Not only did he deliver
          exactly what I asked, he also came through with recommendations on how
          to improve the product to maximize conversions. He's a talented dude
          who follows through on promises, communicates regularly and delivers
          on time. I'm looking forward to our next project together."

          "Very easy to work with, understood the brief and listened to our
          feedback. I would definitely recommend working with Silvestru - a
          great writer and a great guy, too."

          solid copy and always meets deadlines. Highly recommended."

          "This guy knows what he's doing. This guy is very reliable. I have
          hired Silvestru in the past to help me come up with a concept,
          storyboard and copy for a client's video. It wasn't a small project
          and I had nine (paid) people send me their initial drafts. His
          concepts stood out and he was very easy to work with. I only proposed
          the top three concepts to the client and Silvestru's work was in it."
