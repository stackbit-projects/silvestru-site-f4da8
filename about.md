The only reason I got into copywriting was for the money.

Oops, did I say that out loud?

Yep.

Let me unpack that and show you how this is actually good for you:

When I was a starving arts student in 2012, I stumbled upon the world of direct-response copywriting.

As the name implies, DR copy is all about getting the response - doing *only what works*.

Doing what works is not always common sense. Or “nice”. Or “decent”.

In fact, the more education degrees one has, the higher probability that “what works” might seem like utter insanity… TO YOU.

To the market which that direct-response message is directed however - that kind of insanity often pays dividends.

It’s like real-life: people *say* they read the Bible (and it rates #1 consistently in polls over time).

However *actual sales data* shows that goldies like the National Enquirer and Playboy continue to be top sellers (admitedly a dated example - just imagine I have a 70s moustache and wearing disco pants).

A winning ad begins with deep, “X-Files Agent Mulder”-like research, poking and prodding.

But even if you have done the research and have a great product - do you know what to do next? Do you know how to communicate in a way that is efficient, makes you stand out and helps you get the sale?

If you’ve read this far I’m assuming that you need some kind of help in this regard. Send me a message and let’s see if there’s a way for me to take your money… and help you make more in return ;)
