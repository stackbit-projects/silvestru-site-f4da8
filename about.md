If you’re looking for a grand mission statement like “making the world a better place” or “saving the unicorn population”, I will have to disappoint you.

Although those may be noble goals, they are just words.

But beyond words lies our actions - our work.

What I’m interested in, and I hope that you are as well, is **doing the work and doing it well**.

Doing it in such a way that people remember you.

Going the whole hog, including the postage.

Short story to illustrate my point:

Back in 2017, I went broke in London.

With less than a month’s rent left in my bank account, I had to improvise - and fast!

For some reason, and probably because my desperation was palpable - I could not get any writing work.

I sulked for a couple of days but then the idea of doing handy work - like cleaning houses - kicked in.

Now London is a competitive city - so even cleaning jobs had people fighting for them! And how do you choose from 100 cleaners in your area who jam the same dull, old, boring “cleaning services” flyer in your inbox?

I thought this through and decided - nay, I was forced - to take matters into my own hands.

I printed out 1000 flyers. But there was a twist:

On the reverse I put a list of actionable tips: “7 ways to clean your house without harsh chemicals”.

Doing this I hoped to improve the chances of it not being thrown away just like any other piece of junk mail.

If you make your advertising useful, people will keep it and remember you for it.

Did it work?

It did.

I rubbed and I scrubbed and God was I tired... but I had enough work to stay afloat for a while - without competing with anyone or waiting for someone to give me a hand-out.

Another benefit - which happened quite accidentally - was that those tips attracted people who had either allergies or were wary of using regular cleaning products.

So in a way, it was like finding a niche in this competitive market.

And the "make your advertising useful" part?

People were calling for my services 2 months after the initial mail out - they were saving the flyers… and even thanking me in some cases!

So hopefully now you see what I mean by "doing a good job".

Now if this little story has shed some light on my character and what I'm about - and you’re interested in working together - why don’t you send me a message?
