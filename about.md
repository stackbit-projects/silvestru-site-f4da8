If you're looking for some grand mission statement, you've got the wrong person, bud.

I'm not here to save the world.

Frankly, I don't even know if it's worth saving.

**HOWEVER**

If I may be so blunt, me being interested in money only is actually a good thing for you...

Here's why:

I don't shy away from doing what works, even if that sometimes involves getting a little dirty.

How dirty?

Depends on the job and how deep the hole I'm digging.

Like that one time when I was broke in London and I was cleaning an old lady's house.

Her decrepit arthritic 70 year old husband came up to me one day and said

*"What da ya reckon laddy, will you give me a wash too?"*

*"Well Sir, if the price is right ;))))"* I told him in my best American huckster tone, as I proceeded to vomit a little on the inside.

So... if you've got a project, why don't you try me?

What's the worst that can happen?

It's the Internet after all. It's not like people can't be trusted, right? Right?

Oh well, I rest my case.

You know where to find me. You can also check out what other people have said about me - if you can trust that I haven't tampered with the evidence.

OK I'm stopping now.
