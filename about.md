**“I Swear to Tell the Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But the Truth So Help Me God”**

The primary reason I’m doing this is for the money.

The secondary reason I’m doing it is because I’m fascinated by the paradox of what people ***say*** they want… and what they actually ***do***.

I’m not here to save the world.

Frankly, I don’t think the world needs saving.

What I am interested in is facing the music.

To dive deep and go the whole hog.

To ask questions such as “is this really the most efficient way to do it?... or am I just laying on my biases on how the world SHOULD be and not HOW IT IS”.

“How it is” is not always pretty and wearing a unicorn hat.

But it works.

You may not agree with it, you may even hate it - but it works.

Shitty is pretty.

Proof is in the pudding.

Do the work... so you can gorge yourself with tasty, high-calorie, pie.

If you too are on such a mad man’s quest, then it could prove fruitful for us to talk - and who knows, maybe even do things together.

If this resonates, don’t hesitate, get in touch.
