If you’re looking for a grand mission statement like “making the world a better place” or “saving the unicorn population”, I will have to disappoint you.

Although those may be noble goals, they are just words.

But I'd rather you judge me by my actions than my words.

Quite the pickle - I know - seeing that I'm a copywriter...

Well, alright.

You want values and principles?

**Do the work and do it well**.

Do it so that people remember you.

> Go the whole hog, including the postage.

Short story to illustrate my point:

Back in 2017, I went broke in London.

With less than a month’s rent left in my bank account, I had to improvise - and fast!

For some reason, and probably because my desperation was palpable - I could not get any writing work.

I sulked for a couple of days but then the idea of doing handy work - like cleaning houses - kicked in.

Now London is a competitive city - so even cleaning jobs have people fighting for them.

Did I stand a chance if I went toe-to-toe with the cleaning miss Martas and Ralucas of the world?

Unlikely.

Not if I went the direct route.

Nobody wants to see the 101th "cleaning services" flyer in their already jammed mail box.

I thought this through and decided - nay, I was forced - to take matters into my own hands.

So I did print out 1000 flyers.

But there was a twist:

I wanted them to remember it and I wanted them to **hold on to it**.

How?

On the reverse, I put a list of actionable tips: “*7 ways to clean your house without harsh chemicals*”.

One thing I learned is that if you make your advertising useful, people will keep it and remember you for it.

And remember me they did.

I started getting calls, slowly at first.

But as I started doing more jobs, weeks and even months later - I was still getting new calls!

People thanked me for the information and asked me if I could help them with their cleaning errands.

And I discovered quite accidentally - that those tips attracted people who had either allergies or were wary of using regular cleaning products.

So in a way, I found a niche in this quite competitive market.

The cleaning situation lasted for about 2 months.

It got me out of my head and into my body and I had enough to pay my rent and buy some Reese's at the end of the day.

Lesson learned.

Now while I may not be cleaning houses anymore...

I sure can help you clean the profits, dollars and cents that are laying about in your lists and current customers through engaging copy and sound marketing strategy.
